# Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction

This repository houses a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed for the statistical analysis and predictive modeling of heart disease using clinical and physiological data.

## Overview

Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. Early prediction and diagnosis can significantly increase the chances of recovery and reduce the risk of more severe health issues. The notebooks contained herein utilize data analysis and machine learning techniques to explore, analyze, and predict heart disease risk based on clinical data.

## Notebooks Description

### 1. Presentation.ipynb

A presentation notebook that visualizes the statistical relationship between various factors and heart disease. The presentation is structured to provide insights into the distribution and correlation of risk factors contributing to heart disease.

### Slides:

- Introduction and objectives
- Data description and preliminary analysis
- Detailed statistical insights on age, gender, and chest pain with heart disease incidence
- Correlation heatmap and interpretative discussion
- Conclusive insights and potential strategies for medical intervention
- Q&A for interactive audience engagement

### 2. Untitled37 (1).ipynb

An interactive predictive model implemented using logistic regression. It provides a user-friendly interface for clinicians or individuals to input patient data and receive a risk assessment.

### Features:

- Data cleaning and feature selection for model training
- Logistic regression model to predict the probability of heart disease
- Visualization of prediction probabilities
- Interactive widgets for entering patient data and displaying the prediction outcome

### 3. Risk Analysis.ipynb

This notebook acts as a risk analysis tool, providing a detailed risk score based on various health parameters through an interactive web widget.

### Functionalities:

- Import and display of dataset information
- Widgets for inputting patient-specific data for analysis
- Computation and display of a risk score based on the input data
- Recommendations and analysis based on the computed risk
